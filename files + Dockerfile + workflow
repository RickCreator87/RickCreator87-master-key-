Why Railway?  
- Easy Docker support  
- Exposes a public URL you can paste into your GitHub App webhook settings  

4.1. Push your code

Make sure all Python backend files + Dockerfile + workflow are committed:
```
`bash
git add .
git commit -m "Master AI backend Python: Docker + CI"
git push origin main
```

4.2. On Railway

1. Go to Railway, create a new project → Deploy from Repo  
2. Select your backend repo  
3. Railway detects the Dockerfile  
4. Set environment variables in Railway’s Variables UI (matching your .env):
```
   - PORT=8000
   - GITHUBAPPID=2498944
   - GITHUBPRIVATEKEY_BASE64=...
   - GITHUBWEBHOOKSECRET=...
   - GITHUBCLIENTID=lv23il5SuXs68dmGM3jK
   - GITHUBCLIENTSECRET=... (if you use OAuth)
   - DEEPSEEKAPIKEY=...
   - OPENAIAPIKEY=...
   - OLLAMA_HOST=http://ollama:11434 (if you also deploy Ollama; otherwise your external host)
```
5. Deploy. Railway will give you a public URL like:
```
   `text
   https://master-ai-backend-production.up.railway.app
   `

Your GitHub App Webhook URL should then be:

`text
https://master-ai-backend-production.up.railway.app/github/webhook
`

Paste that into:

- GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → RickCreator87-master-key → General → Webhook URL

Make sure the Secret in the App UI matches GITHUBWEBHOOKSECRET in Railway vars.
```

5. Smoke-test checklist (to prove it’s alive)
```
Once deployed & wired:

1. Check Railway logs  
   - Confirm the app starts: “Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:8000” or similar.

2. Trigger an event:
   - Install the app on a test repo (if not already).  
   - Open a new PR in that repo, or push a commit.

3. Watch logs:
   - You should see log lines from github_webhook handler:
     - “Webhook received” with event type pull_request / push / etc.  
   - If you see “invalid signature”, your secret doesn’t match.

4. Check PR:
   - If your pr_analysis.py is wired to actually comment, you should eventually see an AI comment appear on the PR.  
   - If you haven’t set real AI keys yet, you can temporarily mock routetomodel to return a static string just to prove the path works.
```
